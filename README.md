👋 Hi, I’m @adiraj66132

🚀 I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and C/C++ Programmer who thrives in Linux environments.

👀 I’m interested in building robust backend systems, sleek frontends, and exploring systems programming, open-source contributions, and low-level optimizations.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into:
- Advanced C++ (Modern C++ features, STL, multithreading)
- Scalable backend architectures (Python, Node.js)
- React + Tailwind for stunning frontends
- Linux shell scripting and system-level programming

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Full-stack web applications
- Performance-critical C/C++ projects
- Developer tools and open-source Linux utilities

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love tweaking dotfiles, customizing my Linux desktop, and turning coffee into code.
